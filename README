I have fixed up this program so that it now compiles and runs
successfully in my Mac.  I have otherwise left it untouched.

This appears to be a mirror, and the last update seems to be from
2005.  This contains a lot of very useful information about Elgin
watches.  These two pages are essential reading to understand Elgin's
classification system, which the program uses in its output:

    http://elginwatches.org/help/elgin_grade_class.html
    http://elginwatches.org/help/serial_number_info.html

These further pages provide more generic information about watches
 that will help the non-collector (though many collectors will learn
 something from them):

    http://elginwatches.org/help/watch_jewels.html
    http://elginwatches.org/help/watch_sizes.html

See INSTALL for directions on how to install pw_elgin.
See LICENSE for what you can and can't do with this.
See CHANGES for a full list of changes since v1.0

Unfortunately, I haven't had time to write up nice documentation about
pw_elgin yet.  You are going to have to wing it for now.  The
following is the output from a "pw_elgin -h"

Usage:  pw_elgin [search options]

    -s          Enter "search" mode.
    -S          Enter grade "search" mode.
    -v          increase verboseness
    -n          Print serial number data
    -g          Print grade data
    -V          Verify serial number and grade databases
    -N <file>   Use <file> for serial number database
    -G <file>   Use <file> for grade database
    -p <prompt> Prompt string to use in search mode
    -l <file>   Log searches in <file>

If no search options are given, pw_elgin will enter the search mode


Search Options:

serial number	The serial number, if given, must be the first option
		on the line.  Both '*' and '?' can be used as wild cards

n=<name>	limit search to watches with a given name.  All "names"
		are two or three letter abbreviations, or the special names
		of '-' or '?'.
r=<reg type>	limit search to watches with a given regulator type.

grade		Search the grade database instead of the serial number
		database.
sn			Search the serial number database instead of the grade
		database.

b		limit search to watches that are bridge movements.
nb		limit search to watches that are not bridge movements.

hc		limit search to watches with hunter case movements.
of		limit search to watches with open face movements.
cvt		limit search to watches with convertable movements.
ss		limit search to watches with a sweep second hand.
ns		limit search to watches with no second hand.

g		limit search to watches with gilded finishes.
n		limit search to watches with nickel damaskeening.
t		limit search to watches with two-tone damaskeening.
f		limit search to watches with flat (matte) nickel finishes.

kw		limit search to watches key wind/key set movements.
l		limit search to watches lever set movements.
p		limit search to watches pendant set movements.
aw		limit search to watches with auto-wind movements.
hs		limit search to watches with hack setting movements.

gb		limit search to watches with going barrels.
mb		limit search to watches with motor barrels.
jb		limit search to watches with jewelled motor barrels.

In the following options, the '=' can be replaced with '<', '<='
'>', or '>='.

g=<grade>	limit search to watches of a given grade number.
c=<class>	limit search to watches in a given class.
s=<size>	limit search to watches of a given size.
j=<jewels>	limit search to watches with a given number of jewels.
m=<model>	limit search to a given model within a size.
t=<count>	limit search to watches with a total production count.
y=<year>	limit search to watches in a given year.
l=<lines>	limit output to a given number of lines.
v=<verbose>	control how verbose the output should be.


Examples:

pw_elgin 12345
This will tell you about serial number 12345.


pw_elgin H71????

This will tell you about all watches in the ranges that begin
with the serial number "H71".


pw_elgin "12???321 s<=12 j>21"

This will tell you about all watches that have serial numbers
starting with '12', followed by any three numbers and ending
in '321'.  The watches must also be 12s or smaller and have more
than 21 jewels.  This happens to show two different watches, one
a grade 194 and one a grade 190

It is important to put quotes around the search options in this
case or the shell will interpret the "j>21" as redirecting
output to the file "21"


pw_elgin "131????? n=bwr j=19 s=18"

This will end up finding a single run of grade 240 BWRaymonds.
