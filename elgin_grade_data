#  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
#  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
# 
# 			    Preamble
# 
#   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
# freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
# License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
# software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
# General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
# Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
# using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
# the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
# your programs, too.
# 
#   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
# price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
# have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
# this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
# if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
# in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
# 
#   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
# anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
# These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
# distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
# 
#   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
# gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
# you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
# source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
# rights.
# 
#   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
# (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
# distribute and/or modify the software.
# 
#   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
# that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
# software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
# want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
# that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
# authors' reputations.
# 
#   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
# patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
# program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
# program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
# patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
# 
#   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
# modification follow.
# 
# 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
#    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
# 
#   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
# a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
# under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
# refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
# means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
# that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
# either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
# language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
# the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
# 
# Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
# covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
# running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
# is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
# Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
# Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
# 
#   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
# source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
# conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
# copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
# notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
# and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
# along with the Program.
# 
# You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
# you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
# 
#   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
# of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
# distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
# above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
# 
#     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
#     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
# 
#     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
#     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
#     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
#     parties under the terms of this License.
# 
#     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
#     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
#     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
#     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
#     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
#     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
#     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
#     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
#     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
#     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
# 
# These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
# identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
# and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
# themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
# sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
# distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
# on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
# this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
# entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
# 
# Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
# your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
# exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
# collective works based on the Program.
# 
# In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
# with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
# a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
# the scope of this License.
# 
#   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
# under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
# Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
# 
#     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
#     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
#     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
# 
#     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
#     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
#     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
#     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
#     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
#     customarily used for software interchange; or,
# 
#     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
#     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
#     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
#     received the program in object code or executable form with such
#     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
# 
# The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
# making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
# code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
# associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
# control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
# special exception, the source code distributed need not include
# anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
# form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
# operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
# itself accompanies the executable.
# 
# If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
# access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
# access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
# distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
# compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
# 
#   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
# except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
# otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
# void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
# However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
# this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
# parties remain in full compliance.
# 
#   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
# signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
# distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
# prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
# modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
# Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
# all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
# the Program or works based on it.
# 
#   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
# Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
# original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
# these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
# restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
# You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
# this License.
# 
#   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
# infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
# conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
# otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
# excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
# distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
# License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
# may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
# license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
# all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
# the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
# refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
# 
# If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
# any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
# apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
# circumstances.
# 
# It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
# patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
# such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
# integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
# implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
# generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
# through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
# system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
# to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
# impose that choice.
# 
# This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
# be a consequence of the rest of this License.
# 
#   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
# certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
# original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
# may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
# those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
# countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
# the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
# 
#   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
# of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
# be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
# address new problems or concerns.
# 
# Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
# specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
# later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
# either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
# Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
# this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
# Foundation.
# 
#   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
# programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
# to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
# Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
# make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
# of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
# of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
# 
# 			    NO WARRANTY
# 
#   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
# FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
# OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
# PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
# OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
# MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
# TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
# PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
# REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
# 
#   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
# WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
# REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
# INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
# OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
# TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
# YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
# PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
# POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
# 
# 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
# 
# 	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
# 
#   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
# possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
# free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
# 
#   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
# to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
# convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
# the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
# 
#     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
#     Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
# 
#     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
#     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
#     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
#     (at your option) any later version.
# 
#     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
#     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
#     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
#     GNU General Public License for more details.
# 
#     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
#     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
#     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
# 
# Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
# 
# If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
# when it starts in an interactive mode:
# 
#     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
#     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
#     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
#     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
# 
# The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
# parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
# be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
# mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
# 
# You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
# school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
# necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
# 
#   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
#   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

# 
# This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
# proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
# consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
# library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
# Public License instead of this License.





#
# Format of this file:
# 
# lines beginning with a '#' are comments lines, blank lines are
# ignored.  Comments starting in the first column are for describing the
# contents of the file.  Comments starting after the first column (that is,
# they have a tab or spaces before the '#') refer to the preceding grade
# data and will be listed in the search output if the "verbose" setting is
# high enough.
#
# Data lines contain the following information, separated by spaces:
#
#	grade		The grade number for this info
#
#	class		The class that this grade belongs to, or '?" if unknown
#
#	dial_size	The size of the dial that this grade uses, or '?' if
#			unknown
#
#	mvt_size	The size of the actual movement.  If same as dial size
#			then use '-'.
#
#	plate		The plate layout:
#				fp	full plate

#				-	No second hand 
#				?	Unknown
#
#                       Keywind watches are listed as "hunter case" because
#                       that is how Elgin listed them.
#
#                       Keywind, convertable and sweep second watches could
#                       be put into either hunter or open face cases.

#				k	Key wind/key set
#				l	Pendant wind, lever set
#				p	Pendant wind and set
#				a	Automatic wind, pendant set
#				h	Hack setting, pendant wind
#				?	Unknown
#
#                       Some grades were "transitional", and had both keywind
#                       parts, and could be wound by the pendant.
#
#	train		Train speed

#                               v       very fast train:  6 beast per second
#				j	"Jitter bug"  40 beats per second
#				?	Unknown
#
#	jewels		Number of jewels.  May be a range such as 13-15
#
#	adjustments	Number of adjustments.  May be a range as in A1P-A3P
#
#			A watch can be adjusted to heat, cold, isochronism
#			and the 6 faces (positions) of a cube.
#
#			The two temperature adjustments require either
#			a "split balance wheel", or materials that
#			don't change with temperature such as "invar".
#			A split balance isn't enough, however, to make
#			it fully compensated.  You also have correctly
#			place the timing screws.  So some watches are
#			marked as being "temperature adjusted"
#
#			Isochronism is the ability of the watch to
#			keep the same time when fully wound as when it
#			is wound down.  This is done by selecting the
#			right materials for the hairspring, the
#			mainspring, by shaping the hairspring, and
#			sometimes adding things like stop works and/or
#			fuses.  In practice, no watch is really
#			isochronic and it is not clear to me what
#			watch manufactures actually mean by this.
#
#			Adjusting a watch to positions requires
#			correct oiling, the shaping of the ends of the
#			pinions, and adjusting the spread of the curb
#			pins.  (among other things.)
#
#			Elign frequently marks watches as having "x
#			adjustments", where 'x' is some number greater
#			than three.  This means that it has been
#			adjusted to temperature (2 adjustments),
#			isochronism (1 adjustment) and x-3 positions.
#
#			For this database, I always translate this
#			into the AnP form.
#
#			Until around 1910 or so, Elgin just marked
#			their movements as "adjusted", and did not
#			list the number of positions.  How many
#			adjustments Elgin made varied by the grade of
#			the watch.  I think that watches marked
#			"adjusted" were always at least A1P, but I'm
#			not certain.
#
#				U	Unadjusted
#				A	Adjusted  (number of positions unknown)
#				AT	Adjusted to temperature
#				AP	Adjusted to positions
#				AnP	Adjusted to 'n' positions
#
#	wi_avail	Is a wind indicator available for this grade?
#				-	no, no wind indicator option
#				WI	yes, this grade had wind indicators
#
#	wind_hrs	Number of hours that the watch would run when wound.
#			A value of '-' means the default of 32 or 40, I'm not
#			sure which.  
#
#	regulator	Type of regulator:
#				f	The regulator can be freely moved
#				e	The standard "elgin style" micrometric
#					regulator.  The regulator is held in
#					place by a "spool" shaped nut that is
#					threaded on a curved rod.  Precise 
#					adjustments can be made by turning the
#					nut.
#				r	The "railroad patent regulator".  This
#					is similar to the standard "elgin"
#					style regulator, except that it has a
#					spring under the balance cock that
#					holds the regulator to one side of the
#					regulator nut.  This makes adjusting
#					even more accurate.
#				o	The "old style regulator".  This is
#					found on some early 16s watches before
#					the standard "elgin" style came out.
#					it has a screw on the balance cock
#					that can force the regulator in one
#					direction only.
#				b	the "ball style" regulator which has
#					a 'J' shaped spring on top of the
#					balance cock and a screw to move the
#					regulator back and forth.
#
#	barrel		The type of mainspring barrel the watch has
#				gb	The normal "going barrel" 
#				mb	The "motor barrel".  It can be 
#					distinguished by the 3 screws on the
#					top of the barrel
#				jb	The Jewelled "motor barrel".  Like
#					the motor barrel, but with a jewelled
#					staff to reduce friction.
#
#	names		The names that this watch was called by.  Most 
#			pocket watches would have this name engraved on the
#			movement, while wrist watches usually just had the
#			name on the dial instead.  The same grade was sometimes
#			labelled several different names, with some names
#			being much rarer than others.
#
#			If a grade could either be named, or nameless, then
#			the name of '-' is used to say that it was nameless.
#
#	comments	There are optional comments that start with a '#'.
#			This comments will always be listed in the "notes"
#			listing for this grade.
#
# Following the data line, there can be additional grade specific 
# comment lines.  These lines have blanks or tabs before the '#' and these
# comments will be listed in the search output if the "verbose" setting
# is high enough.

	#         The "name" section of the grades says that FR is in class 46
	#	  there are no grades listed in class 46, just the name FR
	# 1896 MC says:

	#         the "classification of mvts" says that FR is in class 46,

	#	  there are no grades listed in class 46, just the name FR
	#	  There are only three runs of G=23.  In the SN list, the

One hand appears to be a second hand, the other appears to be a minute hand, no hour hand.  The seller (Roy Ehrhardt) says that it is a "60-min timer", but that apears to be for the min hand and my notation is to use the time of the quicker hand.  The balance wheel is larger than a jitter bug, so I'm assuming that it is quick train.  This would alsmo match the 5 tics per sec on the dial.

#
# NOTES:
#
# Some of this info was "guessed" and wasn't just marked as unknown.  In
# particular, I know I made the following assumptions:
#
# * all movement sizes are assumed to be the same as the dial size until
#   I've seen evidence otherwise.
#
# * The dial size can often be determined by the "dial" and
#   "hands/hour and minute" columns of the 1950 MC.
#
# * all grades after G=416 were assumed to be quick train unless shown
#   otherwise.  (The only exception has been the "jitterbug" 40bps)
#
# * The barrel type was initially filled out as follows:
#
#	if( plate == PLATE_FULL )
#	    barrel = BARREL_GOING;
#	else if( max_jewels >= 23 )
#	    barrel = BARREL_JMOTOR;
#	else if( mvt_size == 18 && max_model >=8 )
#	    barrel = BARREL_MOTOR;
#	else if( max_jewels < 15 )
#	    barrel = BARREL_GOING;
#	else
#	    barrel = BARREL_UNKNOWN;
#
#   However, I believe the barrel stuff was all checked with the 1950 MC,
#   So this really isn't an assumption anymore.
#
# * all watches with less than 15 jewels are were assumed to be unadjusted
#
# * Regulator info
#
#   * The "elgin patent" (notched spool on a threaded rod) info is
#     based off of the 1950 MC in the NUTS/"regulator nut and screw"
#     column
#
#   * The "Railroad patent" (enhanced elgin with a spring to keep the
#     regulator from moving in the notch) info is based off the 1950 MC
#     in the SPRINGS/"regulator" column.  That is, unless it is a "Ball"
#     style regulator
#
#   * the "Old Style Railroad Patent" is based off the 1950 MC in the
#     SPRINGS/"regulator" column (X826).
#
#   * The "Ball regulator" info is based off the 1950 MC in the
#     SCREWS/"regulator adjusting" column.
#
#
# * When a grade says that the "1915 MC 'Grade of Mvt' list implies
#   possible marking", it means that I looked at the "name" section of
#   that table and did a search on the info on the rest the line.  For
#   example, for the Avery, I did a search of "grade c=15 s=17 hc g
#   m=1 j=7", which returned grades 14, 51 and 59.  I then marked all
#   three of those grades with that note.
#
#   If there was only one possible grade, I marked the grade as having that
#   name.  If there were more than one possible grade, I just left a comment.
#
# * If a watch has a "setting spring cam", then it is pendant set, but
#   not all pendant set watches have a "setting spring cam".  (This is the
#   lever that lets you put the watch in "setting mode" when it is out of
#   the case so that you can work on it.  Lever set watches obviously don't
#   need this, but it isn't required for the functioning of a pendant set
#   watch either.)
#
# * the style can sometimes be determined by the "hands/second" column of
#   the 1958 MC.  In particular, if nothing is listed, then it is a
#   STYLE_NONE, while STYLE_SS will be marked with "S.S."
#
#


#
# the 1915 MC shows the 6s m=2 cut without fourth screw on the barrel
# bridge, but the 0s m=1 with a fourth screw.  However, it appears that
# either of these models can either have this screw or not, so this isn't
# a "distinguishing feature."  (That is, you can't use it to tell these
# to models apart in anotherwise blury picture.)
#
# I'm not sure what exactly this fourth screw is for.  One screw is a
# case screw, the other two screws are for securing the bridge.
#
# on 01/09/00 I did a study to see which grades had screws, and this
# is what I came up with.  *IF* there is a screw, then the location of
# the screw is a "distinguishing feature."  Also, it appears that these
# extra screws show up somewhere around G=200 or so.
