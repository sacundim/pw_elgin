How to install pw_elgin
-----------------------

LINUX VERSION

   Source distribution:
   --------------------  

   Untar / gunzip the distribution file.  Change to the pw_elgin
   directory and type make.  The source is pretty generic C code, but
   it does use the GNU readline library.  If you don't have this
   library, you will need to edit the make file and remove the
   -DHAVE_READLINE flag from the compiler flags.

   You might also want to set up the directory that pw_elgin looks for
   the database source files.  By default, it uses the paths that I
   use for development purposes.

   I realise I haven't done much to make this painless, maybe someday
   I'll learn all about autoconf and do it right.  Until then, if you
   have any problems compiling it feel free to send an email and we
   can try it out together.

   If you build it on something other than Intel Linux, let me know
   what changes were needed.

   Binary distribution
   -------------------
   The binaries were built statically linked all around so should work
   on just about any Intel Linux box unless for some reason you haven't
   made the switch to elf yet :-o .

   To install, pick a nice place for your executable (pw_elgin) and 
   put it there ( /usr/local/bin might be a good choice ).

   By default, pw_elgin will look for the databases in the current
   directory.  You need to make sure you that you are in the right
   directory when you start pw_elgin.
